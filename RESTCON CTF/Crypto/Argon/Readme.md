# Argon

![](./Images/ArgonCrypto.png)

So we were given some kind of hash to decrypt... This hash had various different parameters which was pretty new for me!
We need to do some research about the hash,**what's the better place to do research other than GOOGLE? :)**

You can read about this hash [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2)

So now we need to decrypt, there's two way to handle it..
1. Write your own script!
2. Research more about pre-existing scripts!

So I preffered to go with the second option..I came across a **GOLANG** script on **StackOverflow** but it didn't helped me much..

After some more research I came across this [Github Repo](https://github.com/CyberKnight00/Argon2_Cracker) which helped us to crack the **Argon2id** hash.
