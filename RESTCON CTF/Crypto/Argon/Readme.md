**Challenge Description**

![](./Images/ArgonCrypto.png)

So we were given some kind of hash to decrypt... This hash had various different parameters which was pretty new for me!
We need to do some research about the hash,**what's the better place to do research other than GOOGLE? :)**

You can read about this hash [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2)

So now we need to decrypt, there's two way to handle it..
1. Write your own script!
2. Research more about pre-existing scripts!
