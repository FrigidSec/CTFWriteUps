# I Love Symbols

we were given a ciphertext **%@$%%#%$$#$f$e_&b_%(#0%%%f$$#!$$%f%$$*#!%#&d**. Our objective was to decode this and retrieve the flag.

At first when i saw this i thought the symbols were substituted for their respective **Numbers on the keyboard**.

I tested this and replaced all the symbols with their respective numbers and i didnt change the letters that were there in the Ciphertext.

I got this **52455354434f4e_7b_5930555f4431445f544831537d** after decoding it. It looked like of the form **Hexadecimal** to me .

I just used an online tool(https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/hex-analysis) to Convert it to **ASCII** and got the Flag :).
